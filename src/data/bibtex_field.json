    "name": "xref",
    "documentation": "This field is an alternative cross-referencing mechanism. It differs from `crossref` in that the child entry will not inherit any data from the parent entry specified in the `xref` field. If the number of child entries referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, the parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it has not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the `minxrefs` package option. Style authors should note that whether or not the `xref` fields of the child entries are defined on the `biblatex` level depends on the availability of the parent entry. If the parent entry is available, the `xref` fields of the child entries will be defined. If not, their `xref` fields will be undefined. Whether the parent entry is added to the bibliography implicitly because of the threshold or explicitly because it has been cited does not matter. See also the `crossref` field."
